Class 6

This class will mainly consist of content outlined in the previous class.
After we have finished coving this, we will dive into the content below.
We will cover what we have time to cover, and continue where we leave off the following class:

-Today we will look at the Python "Flask" library, as well as explore a little HTML and CSS,
begining the creation of a dynamic website!

files:
- <website files, assorted>

When building a Flask website, you'll often see a few extra folders besides your main Python file (like app.py). These folders help organize your project and keep different types of files separate. Here are the most common ones:

1. Templates Folder
What It Is:
A folder called templates stores HTML files.
Why It’s Important:
Instead of writing all your HTML inside your Python code, you can create separate HTML files. This makes it easier to design and update your website's layout.
Example Use:
You might have a file called home.html that contains the HTML for your home page. In your Python code, you can use Flask’s render_template function to display this HTML.

2. Static Folder
What It Is:
A folder named static is where you keep files that don’t change, like CSS (for styling), JavaScript (for interactivity), and images.
Why It’s Important:
Keeping these files separate makes your project organized. When you want to change the look of your website, you can update the CSS files here.
Example Use:
You might add a file called style.css in the static folder to make your page look prettier.
