CLASS 4: BASIC PROGRAMMING EXERCISES
(Note: It is acceptable to express your answer using plain English or pseudocode—for example, using “<get input from user>” to capture your ideas.)

MC 4.1.1 Defining and Using a Function

def square(x):
    return x * x

result = square(4)
print("Square of 4 is:", result)

What does the function square do?

SOL: It makes the value bigger. It takes as input some value, and returns value * value. (4, 4*4)

What value is stored in result, and what is printed?

SOL: 16, Square of 4 is: 16

How would you modify the function so that it returns the cube of a number instead?

SOL: Change the function name, multiply by x again!


MC 4.1.2: Looping Through a List

colors = ["pink", "red", "green", "blue"]
for color in colors:
    print("I like", color)

What does the list colors contain?

SOL: it contains the colors "red", "green", "blue" strings in python

What is the output of this program?

SOL: "I like red" "I like green" "I like blue"

How can you add another color to the list so that it is included in the printed messages?

SOL: 
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "pink"]
for color in colors:
    print("I like", color)





MC 4.1: What does the following code output?

 def add_numbers(a, b):
  return a + b


 print(add_numbers(3, 4))

 A. 3 4
 B. 7
 C. "7"
 D. Error

SOL: 7


SA 4.1: Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello" to the screen.

SOL: print("Hello)



SA 4.2: Write a Python program that:
 - Defines a variable called tall and sets it equal to True.
 - Uses an if-else statement to print "you are tall" if tall is True, and "you are not tall" otherwise.

SOL:

# TODO: define a variable called tall and set it to True
tall = True

# TODO: use an if-else statement to check some conditions, output some things with python print() function
if tall == True:
    print("you are tall")
else:
    print("you are not tall")
    



SA 4.3: Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and then prints "Even" if the number is even or "Odd" if the number is odd.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
