Today we will do some practice coding problems, implementing some of what we have learned!
We finished the hangman game last class so today we will look at databases, and then some games.
We will incorporate database usage into these games, and also look at some databases in the wild.

This will be a chance to do some hands-on coding, make mistakes, and debug.

memory.py and word_scramble.py are games we can do from here
