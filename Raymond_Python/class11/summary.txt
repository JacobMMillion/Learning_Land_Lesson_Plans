Today we will do some practice coding problems, implementing some of what we have learned!
We started the hangman game last class, so will finish this. We will look at sets and arrays closer.

This will be a chance to do some hands-on coding, make mistakes, and debug.

memory.py and word_scramble.py are games we can do from here
