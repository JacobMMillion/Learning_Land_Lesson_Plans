Class 5

This class will mainly consist of content outlined in the previous class.
After we have finished coving this, we will dive into the content below.
We will cover what we have time to cover, and continue where we leave off the following class:

-Classes! Classes allow us to create reusable objects (like robots or cars), but personalize
them differently! They are used everywhere and are essential in order to follow good OOP prinicples.

-"Juicy Design" for games, and how to implement in python.
